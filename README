After all these years of collecting this stuff, I have finally gotten to the point where I realize a README is in order, if only to keep track of changes and WTF is going on for myself.
The scripts determine a number of facts about the systems, like hostnames, ip addresses, etc.  
Recently have added logic to determine if the system is patched to the correct kernel level, and correct issues with uptime (colons were screwing up output and skewing lines...).
Will need to do a decent job of keeping this up to date as time goes on.

Added the scripts to github.  Repository is monthly_summary at github.com

12-12-2016
Added mysql logic and cleaned up a bunch of stuff in order to get data better normalized.
The dated reports get added to a Maria DB server on host cheddar.  The logic to do that was added as a one liner in monthly_summary4.bash.
In order to populate the DB for the first time I used the following for loop...

> cd /home/dropbox/monthly_summary/outputs; for i in `ls allhosts-*-*-*.csv`; do mysql -e "use ISS_UNIX_DATA; load data local infile '"$i"'  into table base_data fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n'" -uroot --password=ifa6isa9; done

Base
The directory structure that is needed for this script to work properly is listed below.
Highest level directory - monthly_summary
logs - written to as part of the monthly summary script. 
outputs - where the reports are written to.  
tmp - used for transitory files.
scripts - where the scripts are kept.
scripts/RETIRED - legacy directory where I churn revised scripts to.
